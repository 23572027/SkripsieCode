\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces The figure shows the steps in the mesh optimisation algorithm when the current density is used to constrain mesh element sizes. Red region is the cell in the current iteration. The green point is the point being considered in the current iteration of looping through the points in the red region. The next step shows the mesh cells connected to the green point. The last step shows the points which will be compared to the green point. The process repeats from the second step until all cells have been explored and a maximum change of current density for the green point is found. The then algorithm reverts to the next point in the red cell and the process repeats.\relax }}{20}{figure.caption.13}%
