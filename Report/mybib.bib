volume = {21},
year = {2011},
abstract = {We examine the behavior of low frequency flux noise measured in ten Nb-NbO x -Pbln dc SQUIDs in the temperature range 1 K to 20 mK. As previously reported, the flux noise power spectrum S Φ (f) typically scales with frequency as A/f α . Remark ably, the excess noise power A at 1 Hz increases as the temperature is decreased below about 0.7 K, saturating to a value around (10 μΦ α ) 2 /Hz below about 0.2 K. Here we report on the dependence of both the magnitude A and the slope a on the size and linewidth of the SQUID loops. In particular, at the lowest temperatures we find that a declines to values as low as 0.5 in the smallest devices, while a is in the range 0.9-1 for the largest devices.},

abstract = {A major obstacle to using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) as qubits is flux noise. We propose that the heretofore mysterious spins producing flux noise could be O-2 molecules adsorbed on the surface. Using density functional theory calculations, we find that an O-2 molecule adsorbed on an alpha-alumina surface has a magnetic moment of similar to 1.8 mu(B). The spin is oriented perpendicular to the axis of the O-O bond, the barrier to spin rotations is about 10 mK. Monte Carlo simulations of ferromagnetically coupled, anisotropic XY spins on a square lattice find 1/f magnetization noise, consistent with flux noise in Al SQUIDs.},

volume = {99},
year = {2007},
abstract = {We present a new method to measure 1/f noise in Josephson quantum bits (qubits) that yields low-frequency spectra below 1 Hz. A comparison of the noise taken at positive and negative bias of a phase qubit shows the dominant noise source to be flux noise and not junction critical-current noise, with a magnitude similar to that measured previously in other systems. Theoretical calculations show that the level of flux noise is not compatible with the standard model of noise from two-level state defects in the surface oxides of the films.},
