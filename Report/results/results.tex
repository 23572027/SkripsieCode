An incremental approach to testing was done in this project. Each software component was tested before moving on to the next. This section will report on the results of the incremental testing as well as the results of the entire system. Lastly the noise extraction module will be used to calculate the mean square flux noise figure of an actual SQUID design with measured mean square flux noise values.
