\section{Theory and applications of superconductivity}
In order to understand and apply the methods described in \cite{fluxNoiseSquidsStevenAnton} one must first understand the basic theory behind superconductivity as well as some examples of how this theory is used in practice.

\subsection{Superconductivity}
\textcolor{red}{REVIEW NEEDED}

Since the first discovery of superconductivity a couple of successfully theories have been put forth to explain the phenomenon. The London theory is a framework that describes the qualitative behaviour of superconductors and correctly describes perfect diamagnetic and zero resistance but fails to explain the effect on a microscopic level \cite{Golubov_1998}. The London equations (equation \ref{london1} and equation \ref{london2}) \cite{Tinkham_2015} is an addition to Maxwell's equations.
\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\Lambda J_s)
    \label{london1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    h = -c \nabla\times (\Lambda J_s)
    \label{london2}
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda$ is a phenomenological parameter determined through experimentation. The London equations allow us to calculate the current distribution in a superconductor which is very important to the objective of this project. BCS theory put forth a microscopic model of superconductors and explains the phenomenon as a quantum mechanical effect. The details are out of scope for this project but on a crude qualitative level BCS theory can be explained by the pairing of electrons in the crystal lattice of the superconductor allowing them to be considered one particle. These particles are known as cooper-pairs. At extremely low temperatures the formation of these cooper pairs are energetically favourable \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}. Electron pairs in this state can flow through the superconductor unimpeded. BCS theory is the most successful model of superconductivity discovered to date. 

\subsection{The Josephson junction}
In superconducting electronics the active component is the Josephson junction \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}. The Josephson junction refers to a situation where two superconductors are connected through a thin non-conductive barrier. If this barrier is thin enough one can observe what is known as the Josephson effect. This phenomena is can be explained by considering the effect of quantum tunnelling of cooper pairs through the non-conductive boundary. For a sufficiently large barrier one can express the ensemble average wave function in each superconductor independently\cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}:
\begin{equation}
    \Psi = |\Psi(\Vec{r})| \exp{\{i\theta(\Vec{r})\}}
    \label{eq:ensembleWave}
\end{equation}
This is due to the fact that it is energetically favourable for cooper pairs in proximity to one another to lock phases \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super} allowing one to express a large collection of these cooper pairs as one ensemble wave function. The idea that it is energetically favourable for cooper-pairs in proximity to one another extends to the situation where the superconductors are separated by an insulating boundary. When the barrier is sufficiently small the energy of the system can be reduced by the coupling of wave functions in their respective superconductors \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}. This results in cooper-pairs being able to move across the boundary without energy loss. Following the derivation in \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013} one can describe the system behaviour using SchrÃ¶dinger's equation when a voltage is applied to the junction \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}: 
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi_1}{\partial t} = U_1\Psi_1 +K\Psi_2 
    \label{eq:shrod1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi_2}{\partial t} = U_2\Psi_2 +K\Psi_1
    \label{eq:shrod2}
\end{equation}
Here $U_1 = qV/2$ and $U_2 = -qV/2$ \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013} refer to the energy of the two wave functions and $K$ refers to the coupling energy between each wave function. By taking \ref{eq:ensembleWave} and setting $|\Psi(\Vec{r})|$ to $\sqrt{\rho}$ where $\rho$ refers to the cooper pair density in the super conductor one can substitute the result into equations \ref{eq:shrod1} and \ref{eq:shrod2}. From this substitution one can find that the rate of change of electron density on either side of the junction to be described by the following equation \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}:

\begin{equation}
    \dot\rho_1 = \frac{2}{\hbar}K\sqrt{\rho_1\rho_2}sin(\delta)
    \label{eq:charge_dens}
\end{equation}

Where $\rho_1$ is the electron density on one side of the junction. The rate of change of charge on the other side of the junction is simply $\dot\rho_2 = -\dot\rho_1$\cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}. The rate of change of charge is the current and therefore the current through the junction can be expressed as follows \cite{CPRJJ}:

\begin{equation}
    I = I_0sin(\theta_2 - \theta_1)
    \label{eq:joseph}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:joseph} is known as the current-phase relation of the DC Josephson effect.
The phases of the currents on each side of the boundary is described by equation \ref{eq:phasedif} \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}.

\begin{equation}
    \dot\theta_2 - \dot\theta_1 = \frac{qV}{\hbar} = \dot\delta
    \label{eq:phasedif}
\end{equation}

Integrating on both sides yields equation \ref{eq:phaseVoltage}:

\begin{equation}
    \delta(t) = \delta_0 + \frac{q}{\hbar}\int V(t) dt
    \label{eq:phaseVoltage}
\end{equation}

It is important to note that \ref{eq:joseph} is only valid for a limited number of cases and the actual current-phase relation is often more complicated \cite{CPRJJ}. The applications of equation \ref{eq:joseph} is limited to analysing analogue and digital devices based on Josephson junctions \cite{CPRJJ}.

\subsubsection*{The RCSJ model}
\textcolor{red}{The math in this section needs review}
The phase-current and phase-voltage relation makes the assumption of a perfect Junction. This assumption is inaccurate and as such the RCSJ model is used to more accurately model the behaviour of a junction \cite{Tinkham_2015}. The resistively and capacitively shunted junction is a simple model used to describe the dynamics of a junction. As the name implies it consists of a resistor ($R$), capacitance ($C$) and a Josephson current ($I_s$). In a non-ideal junction a displacement current flows between the two superconductors. This displacement current is modelled by the capacitor. The resistive element models the effect of quasi-particle tunnelling across the boundary \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}. Figure \textcolor{red}{Insert fig} depicts the RCSJ model. To derive the current-voltage relation of an RCSJ model one can express the voltage across the parallel components as a function of the current flowing into the junction: 
\begin{equation}
    I = I_csin(\delta)+C\frac{dV}{dt}+\frac{V}{R}
    \label{eq:RCSJ}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:RCSJ} can be re-written using equation \ref{eq:phaseVoltage}. The resulting equation is a second-order non-linear, inhomogeneous differential equation for which analytical solutions are not available. For the simple case when $C=0$ a differential equation of the form of equation \ref{eq:C0} can be obtained.
\begin{equation}
    K = \frac{d\varphi }{d\tau} + sin(\varphi)
    \label{eq:C0}
\end{equation}
This equation can be integrated directly using separation of variables and a Weierstrass substitution \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}. A detailed derivation is listed in appendix \textcolor{red}{List appendix}. The resulting equation describes the dynamics of the phase shift for a constant input current. The frequency of the current through the junction is determined by the dynamics of the phase. The period of the phase-dynamics is the Josephson frequency. Using the Josephson frequency relation \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super},
\begin{equation}
    \omega = \frac{q}{\hbar}V
    \label{eq:JosephsonFreq}
\end{equation}
as well as the period of the equation for the phase, we find the time average voltage of the junction to be \cite{Duzer_1999_Princip_Super}:
\begin{equation}
    V = 
    \begin{cases}
        0 & \quad\text{for } I \le I_c\\
        I_cR[(\frac{I}{I_c})^2-1]^\frac{1}{2} & \quad\text{for } I > I_c\\
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:IVCHAR}
\end{equation}
Graphing equation \ref{eq:IVCHAR} yields the figure below: \textcolor{red}{Insert fig}

\subsection{SQUID's}
An application of the Josephson effect is the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). In essence a SQUID refers to a superconducting ring that contains one or more Josephson junction. This interference effect is analogous to interference one might encounter in the field of optics \cite{DCSQUIDoriginalPaper}. The SQUID is a highly sensitive device that can in some cases measure fields as weak as $5\times 10^{-14} T$ \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}.

\subsubsection*{Flux quantisation}
To understand the basic operation of a SQUID, one must first understand the concept of flux quantisation. To do so we consider a superconducting ring in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. The ring is superconducting, so it exhibits the Meissner effect and thus the current density inside the ring is zero. Recall that the flux through a ring is:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi = \oint \Vec{A} \cdot d\Vec{s}
\end{equation}
Now consider the equation for the current density in a superconductor \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}: 
\begin{equation}
    \Vec{J} = \frac{\rho\hbar}{m}(\nabla\theta - \frac{q\Vec{A}}{\hbar})
    \label{eq:current}
\end{equation}
The current density inside the ring in the superconducting state is zero so equation \ref{eq:current} becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\theta = \frac{q}{\hbar}\Vec{A}
    \label{eq:zeroCur}
\end{equation}
Integrating on both sides around a curve deep inside the superconductor such that the assumption that the current density is zero holds we can express equation \ref{eq:zeroCur} as:
\begin{equation}
    \oint\nabla\theta\cdot d\Vec{s} = \frac{q\Phi}{\hbar}
    \label{eq:intCurrent}
\end{equation}
Recognizing $\nabla\theta$ as vector field with potential function $\theta$, we can simply write the left-hand side of equation \ref{eq:intCurrent} as $\theta(\Vec{r_1}) - \theta(\Vec{r_1})$. One might assume that the left-hand side of the equation \ref{eq:intCurrent} must be equal to zero. This is incorrect because the absolute phase, meaning the potential function $\theta$ cannot be determined and can only be determined up to some constant because the gradient of the scalar potential function will take any constant to zero. Therefore, the phase can only be determined relative to some point. According to \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013} the only limitation we can place on the phase of the wave function is that the wave function must be singularly valued. This is intuitively understood as the fact that a particle cannot have two different amplitudes to be in a certain quantum state as that would imply that it has two probabilities associated with the exact same quantum state \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}. From equation \ref{eq:ensembleWave} one can conclude that the phase can change by any integer multiple of $2\pi$ as this results in the exact same wave function. Equation \ref{eq:intCurrent} then becomes:
\begin{equation}
    2\pi n = \frac{q\Phi}{\hbar}
    \label{eq:fluxQuant}
\end{equation}
Clearly equation \ref{eq:fluxQuant} implies that the flux through the superconducting loop must be quantized as $n$ can only take on integer values.

\subsubsection*{The DC SQUID}
Spurred on by developments in reliable manufacturing processes of Josephson junctions the DC SQUID has become the dominant device in the field of niobium based sensors \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. The initial discovery of the DC SQUID by \cite{DCSQUIDoriginalPaper} in 1964 came shortly after the discovery of the Josephson junction in 1962 \cite{JOSEPHSONJUNCTION}. The simplest realisation of the DC SQUID consists of two Josephson junctions connected in parallel as depicted in figure \ref{fig:squidFig}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{SQUID}

    \caption{A circuit schematic depicting the configuration of a simple DC SQUID. The current $I$ is the bias current and the current $I_s$ is the screening current developed by an external magnetic field}
    \label{fig:squidFig}
\end{figure}

A relationship between the current and the flux through the loop of the SQUID would like to be derived. The current through each Josephson junction is denoted as $I_1$ and $I_2$ for junction 1 and 2 respectively. From figure \ref{fig:squidFig} one can easily see that there are 2 possible paths through the SQUID. Following the derivation of \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013} one can write the change in phase through each branch of the squid using equations \ref{eq:PhaseChange1} and \ref{eq:PhaseChange2} \cite{Feynman_Leighton_Sands_2013}.

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\theta_{1} = \theta_1 + \frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\int_{\text{left branch}} \Vec{A}\cdot d\Vec{s}
    \label{eq:PhaseChange1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\theta_{2} = \theta_2 + \frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\int_{\text{right branch}} \Vec{A}\cdot d\Vec{s}
    \label{eq:PhaseChange2}
\end{equation}
Where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ is the change in phase across their respective junctions. Similarly, $\Delta\theta_1$ and $\Delta\theta_2$ refer to the change in phase through the left and right branch respectively. As previously discussed, the integral of the phase gradient around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of $2\pi$. As a consequence, subtracting equation \ref{eq:PhaseChange2} from \ref{eq:PhaseChange1} must yield $2\pi n$. Using equation \ref{eq:intCurrent} we derive equation \ref{eq:loopInt}.

\begin{equation}
    \theta_2  = \theta_1 - 2\pi n + \frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\Phi
    \label{eq:loopInt}
\end{equation}

Using equation \ref{eq:joseph}, \ref{eq:loopInt} and a KCL at the top or bottom node, the relation between the current going into the loop and the flux through the loop is derived and equation is found. Here the $2\pi n$ term can be neglected as a $2\pi n$ shift in phase does not change the value of the function. 

\begin{equation}
    I = I_2sin(\theta_2) + I_1sin(\theta_2 - \frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\Phi)
    \label{eq:squidI}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:squidI} describes the general behaviour of the DC SQUID. The current voltage characteristics are shown in the figure below \textcolor{red}{Get figure}

\subsection{Practical DC SQUIDS and design considerations}

\subsubsection*{The resistively shunted junction}
Practical realisation of a DC SQUID requires that the designer connect shunt resistors to each junction \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. This is done such that the system is strongly over damped \cite{SQUIDhandbook}. In the context of the discussion on the I-V characteristics  of the Josephson junction the addition of the shunt resistors correspond to the effect of the junction capacitance becoming negligible. In the absence of a shunt resistor the I-V characteristics of a Josephson junction has hysteresis \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. 

\subsubsection*{The uncoupled SQUID}
Below is an example of an uncoupled DC SQUID structure. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{UncoupledSQUID}
    \caption{A diagram of a practical uncoupled DC SQUID structure \cite{DCSQUIDdesignImage}}
    \label{fig:UncoupledSQUID}
\end{figure}
The uncoupled SQUID is the simplest of designs as it only consists of a single superconducting loop with 2 resistively shunted Junctions. The SQUID characteristics are determined by the loop inductance, critical current, shunt resistance and parasitic junction capacitance \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. Design involves choosing the optimal set of these parameters to satisfy the design requirements. This is often not a trivial task due to the non-linear nature of the equations describing the behaviour of the Josephson junction and by extension the DC SQUID. Through extensive simulation a number of key design parameters have been identified \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. The first of which is described by equation \ref{eq:NoisePar} and is referred to as the noise parameter \cite{SQUIDhandbook}. 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma = \frac{2\pi k_bT}{\Phi_0I_c}
    \label{eq:NoisePar}
\end{equation} 
The noise parameter is the quotient of the thermal energy and the Josephson coupling energy \cite{SQUIDhandbook}. It has the effect of an apparent reduction in the critical current of a junction at low voltages \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS}. \newline
The second design consideration is the quality or "Q" factor. For currents the phase shift induced by the Josephson junction can be interpreted as an inductor \cite{SQUIDhandbook}. Under this approximation it is clear to see how the combination of the shunt capacitance and junction create an RC resonator. As pointed out by \cite{Drung2016NBSQUIDS} it is often desirable to keep the quality factor of resonating circuits in non-linear systems close to unity. 

\begin{equation}
    Q
    \label{eq:QFACT}
\end{equation}
