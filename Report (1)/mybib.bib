abstract = {We examine the behavior of low frequency flux noise measured in ten Nb-NbO x -Pbln dc SQUIDs in the temperature range 1 K to 20 mK. As previously reported, the flux noise power spectrum S Φ (f) typically scales with frequency as A/f α . Remark ably, the excess noise power A at 1 Hz increases as the temperature is decreased below about 0.7 K, saturating to a value around (10 μΦ α ) 2 /Hz below about 0.2 K. Here we report on the dependence of both the magnitude A and the slope a on the size and linewidth of the SQUID loops. In particular, at the lowest temperatures we find that a declines to values as low as 0.5 in the smallest devices, while a is in the range 0.9-1 for the largest devices.},

abstract = {A major obstacle to using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) as qubits is flux noise. We propose that the heretofore mysterious spins producing flux noise could be O-2 molecules adsorbed on the surface. Using density functional theory calculations, we find that an O-2 molecule adsorbed on an alpha-alumina surface has a magnetic moment of similar to 1.8 mu(B). The spin is oriented perpendicular to the axis of the O-O bond, the barrier to spin rotations is about 10 mK. Monte Carlo simulations of ferromagnetically coupled, anisotropic XY spins on a square lattice find 1/f magnetization noise, consistent with flux noise in Al SQUIDs.},

A comparison of the noise taken at positive and negative bias of a phase qubit shows the dominant noise source to be flux noise and not junction critical-current noise, with a magnitude similar to that measured previously in other systems. Theoretical calculations show that the level of flux noise is not compatible with the standard model of noise from two-level state defects in the surface oxides of the films.},

The noise is generated by the magnetic moments of electrons in defect states which they occupy for a wide distribution of times before escaping. A trapped electron occupies one of the two Kramers-degenerate ground states, between which the transition rate is negligible at low temperature. As a result, the magnetic moment orientation is locked. Simulations of the noise produced by randomly oriented defects with a density of 5x10(17) m(-2) yield 1/f noise magnitudes in good agreement with experiments.},

volume = {3},
year = {2022},
abstract = {Parasitic two-level-system (TLS) defects are one of the major factors limiting the coherence times of superconducting qubits. Although there has been significant progress in characterizing basic parameters of TLS defects, exact mechanisms of interactions between a qubit and various types of TLS defects remained largely unexplored due to the lack of experimental techniques able to probe the form of qubit-defect couplings. Here we present an experimental method of TLS defect spectroscopy using a strong qubit drive that allowed us to distinguish between various types of qubit-defect interactions. By applying this method to a capacitively shunted flux qubit, we detected a rare type of TLS defect with a nonlinear qubit-defect coupling due to critical-current fluctuations, as well as conventional TLS defects with a linear coupling to the qubit caused by charge fluctuations. The presented approach could become the routine method for high-frequency defect inspection and quality control in superconducting qubit fabrication, providing essential feedback for fabrication process optimization. The reported method is a powerful tool to uniquely identify the type of noise fluctuations caused by TLS defects, enabling the development of realistic noise models relevant to noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing and fault-tolerant quantum control.},
