Warning: Some columns of the Jacobian are effectively zero at the solution, indicating that the model is insensitive to some of its parameters.  That may be because those parameters are not present in the model, or otherwise do not affect the predicted values.  It may also be due to numerical underflow in the model function, which can sometimes be avoided by choosing better initial parameter values, or by rescaling or recentering.  Parameter estimates may be unreliable.
